// Second, the endpoint https://searchcaster.xyz/api/profiles?username=dwr
// fetches profile information for a Farcaster user once you know their username (e.g. dwr).
// This endpoint may be helpful to build the profile table.

// - The backend should support two GET requests. One to get a list of **1000** Farcaster users, and one to get basic profile information for a particular Farcaster user. For this exercise, the data can just be kept in memory, though you are welcome to use a database if you prefer.
// - Farcaster has an excellent API that will make your life easier. First, you may use the endpoint [https://api.farcaster.xyz/v2/user?fid=1](https://api.farcaster.xyz/v2/user?fid=1) to fetch a Farcaster userâ€™s username. The `fid` represents a unique identifier (i.e. a Farcaster ID).  ******************************************************************We only want the users with `fid` 1 though 1000.** This endpoint may be helpful to compile a list of Farcaster users.
// - Second, the endpoint [https://searchcaster.xyz/api/profiles?username=dwr](https://searchcaster.xyz/api/profiles?username=dwr) fetches profile information for a Farcaster user once you know their username (e.g. dwr). This endpoint may be helpful to build the profile table.
//     - For a userâ€™s address, please use the `connectedAddress` field from the Farcaster API, not the `address` field.
// - The frontend does not need to be styled exactly as the above screenshot but should at a minimum include two side-by-side sections, with a list of Farcaster users on the left and profile information for a selected user on the right.
// - When a name in the left-side column is clicked, the right-hand information should update accordingly to reflect information about the newly selected user.
// - Try to document your code! Add comments as you go ðŸ™‚.
